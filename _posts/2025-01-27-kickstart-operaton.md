## Kickstart Operaton – Choose Your Preferred Access Method!

The **Operaton Project**, our free and open-source BPMN engine for everyone, is designed to make **workflow automation** straightforward and easy to use. We're excited to share updates that expand how you can use Operaton in your projects.

### Docker Containers

Our Docker containers are now ready to go!

Here's what they offer:

- **Quick setup** without dependencies.
- Flexibility to run **anywhere** – locally, in CI/CD, or the cloud.
- **Version-controlled images** for easy updates.

With a simple command, you can spin up Operaton in seconds:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 operaton/operaton:SNAPSHOT
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. Log in using the credentials:

### Standalone Distribution

For those who prefer not to use Docker, we’re bringing back the distribution formerly known as **Camunda Run**, now simply **Operaton**.

#### How to get started:
1. Download the ZIP file from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/operaton/operaton/releases) (section: Assets).
2. Unzip the file.
3. Start Operaton with the start script—**no installation required**!

### Nightly Builds on GitHub

Stay up-to-date with the **latest features** by accessing our nightly builds on GitHub. These builds allow you to explore new advancements and provide timely feedback to the project.

### Ensuring Quality with Integration Tests

It’s our goal to establish **rigorous integration tests** to ensure everything functions as expected.

While these tests are not yet fully implemented, they are a key part of what we’re working toward for the **production-ready 1.0 release**. This commitment will ensure a **reliable and high-quality engine** for all users.

### Future Distribution Channels

We’re planning to extend our distribution options even further. Once our **first production-ready release** is available, we aim to provide packages through:
- **Homebrew**
- **Chocolatey**
- And more!

These channels will give you even more ways to start your journey with Operaton.
