## Plugged In: Simplifying Plugin Management with Operaton

At **Operaton**, our mission is to create a seamless and accessible experience for both users and contributors. When it comes to community plugins, we‚Äôve adopted a streamlined approach: **we fork and maintain plugins as needed within our main GitHub organization**. üöÄ

No need for a separate ‚Äúcommunity hub‚Äù or scattered repositories‚Äîevery popular plugin is centrally maintained under the Operaton umbrella. This ensures **quality, reliability, and ease of access** for everyone who uses or contributes to the project.

### The First Fork: Keycloak Plugin

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce our first plugin fork: the popular **Keycloak plugin**!

**Keycloak** is a powerful open-source identity and access management solution that provides:
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Identity Brokering
- Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- Customizable Authentication Flows

With the Keycloak plugin, **Operaton simplifies authentication and authorization for BPMN workflows**, ensuring a secure and user-friendly environment.

### Why Centralized Plugin Management?

By maintaining plugins centrally, we stay focused on what matters most:
- Providing a **robust and cohesive BPMN engine**.
- Ensuring plugins are **always up-to-date and reliable**.
- Making it easier for developers to access, use, and contribute to the project.

### We‚Äôd Love to Hear From You!
