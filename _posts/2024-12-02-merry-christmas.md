Camunda has developed a very good open source process engine over many years with the Camunda 7 Community Edition. Camunda 7 could be easily integrated into existing Spring Boot and other Java applications, or connected as a lightweight external engine. In the Java world and beyond, the name Camunda has enjoyed a high reputation for years. Unfortunately, however, the Camunda 7 Community Edition will discontinued in October 2025. There will be no more support or further development for it. The Community Edition will no longer receive any maintenance.

That is why we have forked the project under the new name **Operaton**.

The artefacts for the fork are available at Maven Central Operaton 1.0.0-Beta. The code is on GitHub. We invite you to test the project and give us feedback. To do so, you can create issues in the repository.

There will be no more closed source components. We want to create complete technical transparency in the engine. We want to build a new community around Operaton and invite you to join.

However, Operaton should not be left in the past. In addition to the existing features, we have created a roadmap that describes how we, together with the community, can make Operaton a modern engine. You can find more information under Roadmap.

## Who is behind Operaton?

We are Tim ZÃ¶ller, Andreas Klein and Andreas Zill. Over the past few years, we have gained a lot of experience with processes and various process engines. We all work professionally in process development and consulting.

We are at the beginning of a new journey and look forward to your support and cooperation. Be it in the exchange of ideas or in development. For this purpose, we have set up a Forum where you can get in touch with us and participate in the project.

**Let's make the world of processes a little more open and free!**

Tim Z., Andreas K. and Andreas Z.
