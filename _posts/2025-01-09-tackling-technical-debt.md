## 🛠️ Tackling Technical Debt: A Path to Long-Term Sustainability

In software development, **technical debt** can feel like a hidden anchor—slowing progress, complicating maintenance, and hindering innovation. At the **Operaton Project**, we’re addressing this head-on to lay a solid foundation for long-term maintainability and modernization.

---

### Key Initiatives

#### 1️⃣ Revamping Our Testing Framework

We’re migrating to **JUnit 5**, not just for modernization’s sake but to establish a **future-proof, extensible, and maintainable test base**.

With over **25,000 test cases**, maintaining tests is already a challenge. Outdated tools discourage contributors from adding new cases. By adopting JUnit 5, we ensure our testing framework meets today’s standards and expectations, making it easier for developers to contribute.

#### 2️⃣ Reducing Technical Debt

Our **Sonar analysis** revealed over **16,000 code issues**—a clear sign of accumulated technical debt. While the overall code quality is decent, the sheer volume of issues creates challenges in maintaining high standards.

Here’s what we’ve achieved so far:
- Addressed **one third of these findings**.
- Set a goal to reduce the debt to **8,000 issues within two months**, with continuous improvement beyond that.

By setting and enforcing higher standards, we’re creating a **cleaner, more maintainable codebase** for the future.

#### 3️⃣ Eliminating Legacy Dependencies

We’re removing outdated **Java EE components**, and this is about more than just "cleaning house." It’s about:
- **Eliminating security risks.**
- **Reducing complexity.**
- **Opening the door for innovation.**

By upgrading to the latest frameworks, we’re leveraging their ongoing improvements in **security, performance, and quality** while avoiding the burden of maintaining both legacy and modern implementations.

### 🌟 Why It Matters

Every part of this effort—from modernizing tests to addressing code quality—is about creating a platform that’s **sustainable, secure, and ready for the future**.

This isn’t just a cleanup—it’s a **strategic renovation** that lays the groundwork for innovation and seamless transitions, including for users migrating from **Camunda 7**.
