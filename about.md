# About Operaton

Operaton is a community driven free open source BPMN engine.

It inherited its source from the legacy of Camunda, Activiti and their predecessors. Camunda 7 was
an important contribution to the open source BPMN community. Building on this legacy we strive to
build a vibrant future for a free open source BPMN engine.

We are currently in the process of founding a legal foundation (a german eingetragener Verein) which
will own the project and its trademark.
